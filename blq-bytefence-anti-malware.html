                            <p>This is the third time I've had to uninstall Bytefence, it first appeared out of nowhere with Chromium and I didn't give a fuck, until Bytefence kept annoying me while I played games, so I uninstalled Bytefence but kept Chromium because Chromium is actually good. A few weeks after uninstalling it, I see it's ads for upgrading to premium on the bottom right of my PC again. How do I permanently remove Bytefence. This is a new problem I've encountered, after typing my lovely password in and logging in, as I move my mouse around I see that it " lags " and freezes for about half a second a few times and then after about 5 seconds it' gone and back to normal, Sometimes opening browser or a program or two shortly can also be a bit slower than usual. I7 4770, SSD for OS and programs like my browser etc, Only new installation was Bytefence Anti Malware which found something called BRD.dll which So I typed gimpshop into google. first result: www.gimpshop.com I followed the download on there, it seems to have bundled a bunch of BS with the actual photoeditor. (I think the true site is www.gimp.org) "Bytefence anti-malware" "Chromium" It seemed too easy to get these on windows. 
About amonth ago i downloaded the new launcher and started loading the game and was meet by an error messege telling me a (.lang) file could not be downloaded. i started browsing for answers but nothing helped. According to the bug tracker website this issues is supposed to be caused by Bytefence. I serched my computer for it and didn't have anything related to the program installed. After that i tried: Reinstalling my whole computer, Manually updating all software, Turning of my firewall, Reins. This is insane. I’ve only ever downloaded from safe websites, but recently an “anti-malware” has installed on my computer for some reason. It’s titled ByteFence, and I can’t use the toolbar, or google. Any software freezes! I just got this new computer, and I don’t want to pay a lot of money just to get a new one, or to get it fixed. Please help me with this. I can’t live with this ByteFence virus. I just can’t. When I got my laptop back in September, a Windows 10, it had the “anti-malware” app known as ByteFence installed. Recently, it’s been telling me I have two or three virus threats that are apparently severe and need to be removed immediately (I only have the demo version, it tells me to buy the full version to “remove the threats”). I’m hyperaware of wording like that, and tonight I’m asking: ##Is ByteFence a legitimate piece of anti-malware programming, or is it scamming. 
I just bought a T470. I upgraded to a SSD and installed a fresh copy of Windows. I read on this subreddit that the Lenovo System Update is a good idea. So I'm trying to run it from the T470 support page (https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t470/downloads). I installed Lenovo Service Bridge when it complained and ran scan. Now it gives me this error: gt There is no TVSU on your computer. Please install TVSU first. I click "Insta. Zemana antimalware seems to detect ByteFence Anti-Malware as malware. Is it normal for an antimalware program to detect another antimalware program as malware? Also there's some other things like PcAcceleratePro and rsUtils.dll that I don't know about. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KxMUd4DjjbCL1yPgOYjL3Ls0C-pmQp__/view?usp=sharing. I have been seeing this popup message every day at 6:00 PM https://imgur.com/a/fCrqI and I don't seem to find anything in task scheduler. It says "There is an update availbale for this PC", and my computer is all up to date. And notice how the word available is misspelled. I have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware installed, I have ran several scans and it says my computer is clean. IDK, is ByteFence legit. 
I have had this laptop for a few months- great laptop which runs great. SSD, Lenovo. I have tried to get Minecraft to run on my PC, which it won't. I tried the Windows 10 Edition the other day, and that runs great. I would prefer to get the general PC version running instead, as I would like to get into World Painter. Can anybody tell me what I am doing wrong? Thanks! EDIT: I realized I didn't talk about what happens when I try to play PC Minecraft. I click the play button (below I am not sure if this is the best subreddit, but before installing software mentioned in the title I searched reddit and it looked legit. After the program installation I got Chromium installed, ByteFence Anti-Malware, Chrome Search Engine Manager extension, Yahoo was made default search engine in all browsers. My tens of Firefox open tabs were permanently gone. When I try to unistall ByteFence Anti-Malware through Program Files it just starts the program. After I uninstalled BurnAware, ByteFe. Hi reddit, I'm terrible at internet security. I recently downloaded a cdr reader and it unknowingly dumped some malware on to my computer (cloud.tv, a version of chromium, etc.) Yes I know I'm stupid for not checking beforehand. But today I log onto my PC and get a notification that a program named Bytefence has scanned and found malware on my computer. I have no recollection of installing Bytefence and want to know if it's legitimate or not. Also a half decent free anti malware software sugges. 
Just thought I would let those of you know that the nifty android emulator Andy OS raises several red flags after a little research. I apologize if this is well known information, but wanted to make sure people are aware. I installed AndyOS earlier today carefully making sure to not install any of the checkbox adware/malware at install, post installation chrome still caught an extension attempting to install itself which would alter my homepage along with adding a search bar. So I decided. I needed to adjust the size of my partitions on my Windows 10 PC so I installed EaseUS Partition Master. I downloaded it from two different sites: and I mistakenly downloaded one version that requires you to buy the software but then got the correct free version. I let the latter configure my partitions. When it restarted my PC, I noticed my browser redirected to a custom Yahoo search engine. I looked. </p>
