Hello, i'm asking for help because i've updated my recently built pc (with old spare parts) to windows 10. Thing is, it went smoothly, but upon installing the 341.74 driver for my 8600 GT everything went to hell. After restarting the screen flickers to the point that I can't read anything or do anything. Any solution? Thanks in advance. GeForce 8800 GT; GeForce 8800 GS; GeForce 8600 GTS; GeForce 8600 GT; GeForce 8500 GT; GeForce 8400 GS. Полная поддержка Microsoft® DirectX Hello r/linux_gaming, I hope it's fine to ask for troubleshooting here. So, yesterday, I attempted to install the proprietary drivers in place of Noveau, because I was apparently missing great deal of libraries needed to run DOTA2, TF2, L4D2, and, in WINE, LoL. Installing proprietary drivers was supposed to be easier, even though less ideal, than getting the libraries to Noveau. So, I went with the supposedly easiest way to switch the driver, which was installing package named "nvidia-xconfig".

When I mentioned this to my Roommate he suggested I update my drivers. I went to the NVIDIA site and downloaded the drivers, and now my computer will not recognize my Graphics card, Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43).

I've been a Linux user (and distro-hopping) for about a year and a half. I've used Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop\_Os!, Manjaro, openSUSE. I've recently gotten into Arch Linux. Arch is good, but I hate that it breaks a lot. Whenever I install nvidia's proprietary drivers, it slows down a lot. I have a Intel Core 2 Duo E6750, Nvidia 8600 GT, with 4GB RAM (I might also upgrade my RAM soon). I mainly do some web browsing and playing light games. Should I stick to Arch Linux? If not, what distros would.

My power supply is Corsair TX650W (bronze I think). When I plug in the Vega, the card fans spins for around 10 seconds and the fans stop after that, although the XFX graphics card lights are still on. I get no display. I suppose there are three distinct possibilities. 1) The card is defective (will try to verify I just switched from my AMD radeon HD 8570 or r7 230 (which ever you'd like to call it) to my old old Nvidia Geforce 8600 GT (2006 card) but I do not have drivers installed to this card and I get more fps in game.

I've searched the internet for quite some time, and found that other people as well have the same or similar problem, but for the most part, didn't find anything that solved the problem. Ok, so the problem is this: I use various programs to chat and talk with people on the internet, and I didn't have any problems because I was using microphone that is in my webcam (USB connection). But now, because. 
Ive recently upgraded my PC and got a new graphics card and since then these crashes have been happening when I play video games. Looks like this : https://imgur.com/DTlxj2r ; https://imgur.com/3qfFbEM and its followed by a short buzzing sound. Once it happens nothing is responding and I can only manually shut down and/or restart my PC after which everything is normal again. If Im playing League I would occasionally get an ˝Unknown directx error˝ message saying my drivers might be faulty I'm not 100% will this happen with all GPU's but so far in my own tests when having two GPU's plugged in PCI-E slots. 8600 GT not plugged in monitor and GTX 680 plugged in monitor. After installing correct drivers for them then rebooting. Windows will reboot normally but right before hitting desktop you get black screen with the circle thing going on and it stays stuck there. If you move mouse it will appear but you can't do anything. Only way to fix the issue is the remove GPU that is plugged. Hello. Yesterday when I left home everything was running normally but when I returned, I was no longer getting monitor signal from my GPU. (HD 7870 XT). I know for a fact that my monitor and my cable are fine because I am getting a signal from the integrated GPU. Things I have tried so far: Unistalled AMD drivers (nothing changed) Placed the GPU in the secondary PCI-E port (the one near the PSU, still nothing) I switched the power supply cables that power the GPU with the secondary. Windows 10 64-bit. The computer has been working fine for over a year with both monitors. This problem started over the last week or so. The monitors are identical and there was no issue with them before now. If I shut down or restart the computer, the Right monitor will display the desktop, but without using the graphic card (afaik); the resolution is low and fuzzy. The Left monitor has power but is not on at all. Restarting it again at this point will cause the Left monitor to display With my current hardware setup, i'm not able to smoothly run most current fps games and also starcraft 2 under wine is a little bit sluggish. I'm looking for recommendations and have two concrete questions: 1. Does buying a new graphics card with a GTX 960 chip help me out or is the bottle neck somewhere else? 2. How about the CPU? I'm not looking at investing 1000€, more like 300€ all in all. Here are my current specs based on the output from phoronix-test-suite: > Phoronix Test Suite. I have a Dell Vostro 1500 laptop that has a VGA out. The graphics adapter is an Nvidia 8600 GT, with a native resolution of 1680x1050. I have a spare small HDTV that I want to use as a second (not primary) screen. It has a VGA port and I was able to connect it just fine to the laptop's VGA out, though the max resolution it showed at first was 1366x768 (although at this res, with "Dot-by-Dot" mode, it takes up a small part of the screen since it is actually 1920x1080 native, being a "Full 
So after playing through Dark souls 1 several times I jumped right into Dark Souls 2 (just the base game). Made it till the endboss, but thought I wanna try the addons too. So saved my savegames, deleted the game and got the SotFS edition through a friend with shared steam library. But after I start the game it just crashes on a white screen. My google-fu didn't help me so far and my driver should be up to date. Would love if someone could help me. I know my pc isn't the strongest but I could.
